A `Block` is a non-branching series of `Step`s that eventually come to some `Completion`. `Completion`s are a bit varied, but they do not always `Branch`. Sometimes a `Completion` is placed due to logic like leaving a `Scope`, or in the case of needing a well defined place to jump to like in a loop.
